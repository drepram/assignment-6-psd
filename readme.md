# histogram experimentation

The histograms (both graphics and code) included here are the Binomial Distribution, Poisson Distribution, and Uniform Distribution. The code was written in Python 3.8.6, and its graphics was created by the help of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).

This is part of the work on the sixth assignment of the Pengantar Sains Data (Introduction to Data Science) class at the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science of the University of Indonesia (FMIPA UI).
